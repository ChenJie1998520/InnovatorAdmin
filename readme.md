# Innovator Admin

Innovator Admin is a tool for managing Aras Innovator installations.  This 
tool consists of several different components including:

- [Innovator Installer](doc/innovator-installer.md)
- [AML Studio](doc/aml-studio.md)

# Recent Changes

**2015-11-30**
- Updates to AML Studio to streamline the interface and add more functionality

# Current Status

Please treat this tool as **alpha** level software.  While some of the 
core functionality has been tested and should work, other peripheral 
features have been blocked out and/or coded but not tested.  In 
particular, exports to/install from the previous manifest file and folder 
structure have not been tested.
